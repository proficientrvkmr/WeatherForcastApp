# WeatherForcastApp
Its a weather forcasting android App.

Steps that I follow to create it:-

1. I have a created a MainActivity class and its main_activity.xml.
2. A ListFragment class is created of Fragment type which have a title and a ListView Container.
3. I created a new AsyncRequest class to create AsyncTask request to the url and fetch the JSON data.
4. on response of the AsyncRequest, I get the JSONResponse and set that data into my CustomWeatherAdapter class.
5. This CustomWeatherAdapter class will help me to add multiple information on single view of ListView.

So , this is my first basic android app.
Hope you like it....!!!!



Thanks,
